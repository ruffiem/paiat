Parallax (almost) in a Tweet

Use the demo.html to see how it work. This version requires jQuery but can easily be done in pure javascript.

How to use ?
```html
<div>
	<img src="path/to/your/picture" data-speed="(float | speed factor)" class="paiat">
</div>
```
The parallax class will be processed at page load and at scroll.
