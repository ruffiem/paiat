Parallax (almost) in a Tweet

Use the demo.html to see how it work. This version requires jQuery but can easily be done in pure javascript.

How to use ?

<div>
	<img src="path/to/your/picture" data-speed="(int | speed factor)" class="parallax">
</div>

The parallax class will be processed at page load and at scroll.
